In the folder "Creating Model and Pickle files" we have created the chosen model saved it and stored the other necessary csv files in the pickle format.

In the "main" folder we have the pickle files generated from "Creating Model and Pickle files" along with the python scriopt to execute it.



NOTE : The program for generating the Pickle files and saving the model is written in such a way that it saves the generated files in teh same directory. We then copied the files from that folder to the main folder.
